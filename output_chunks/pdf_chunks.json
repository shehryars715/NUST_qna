  "Since \nsome courses are purely theoretical, some are purely practical and some have a theoretical \nas well as a practical portion, the grading scheme in the format given below may be \nfollowed by each department for the purpose of uniformity: \nGrading Scheme per Semester \nEngineering / IT / Sciences \nNature of Examination Duration Frequency Weighting \n(%age) \nEnd semester examination  2- 3 hours 1  40-50 \nOne Hour Test(s)* One hour • 1 CH Course – \nminimum 1 OHT  \n• 2-4 CHs Courses – \nminimum 2 OHTs  \n30-40 \nMid Semester Exam 90-120 \nmins \n1 25-35 \nQuizzes  - • 1 CH Course – \nminimum 2  \n• 2 CHs and above \nCourses – minimum 3  \n10-15 \nAssignments Own \ntime@ \n- 5-10 \nProject(s)  Own \ntime@ \n- 10-20 \nLab Work \nLab Work/ Psychomotor \nAssessment/ Lab Reports  \n3 contact \nhours \n1 per week for each lab \nCH \n50-70 \nLab Project/ Open-ended Lab \nProject/ Assignment/Quiz \n- 1-2 10-20 \nFinal Assessment/Mid Semester \nAssessment (Written, viva, hands-on \nexperimentation, group task) \n- 1 20-30 \n \nMid Semester Examination will be held in lieu of OHTs during Summer Semester. @ Duration of own time is decided by the class teacher. NUST Undergraduate Student Handbook 15 \n \n17. For purely theoretical and purely practical courses, the grading scheme is evident in \nthe suggested format. However, for subjects having two categories (theory and practical) \ncombined, the final grade is computed by multiplying the number of credits assigned to \neach category with the percentage mark s obtained in that category and dividing the sum of \nthe two by the total credits in that subject. For example: \n \nExample \nSubject Theory Credit Practical Credit \n% age Marks Earned \nTheory Practical \nPhysics 3 1 70 90 \nOverall grade = (70 X 3+90 X 1)/ (3+1) =75 % \n18. The overall subject percentage thus obtained shall be rounded off by the individual  \nfaculty up to two decimal points. 19.",

It helps students to become well conversant with \nthe NUST Academic Regulations and to overcome their personal and academic issues. a. Structure. All UG freshmen students are assigned  an Advisor who acts as a  \nguardian/mentor of the student to counsel and provide necessary guidance. The students from different academic batches assigned to a particular faculty \nmember form the Advisor Group for that faculty member.",
  "Freshmen students \nare required to attend their session in first week of each month, planned to \nfacilitate, guide, and groom new students during their settling down phase. Furthermore, mandatory advisory sessions are held for students having some \nacademic deficiency  (in 3 rd, 9 th and 15 th week), i.e., CGPA/SGPA less than \nminimum qualifying grade, or having W/XF/F grade in one or more courses. In addition to that, desirous student may request student advisor if s/he \nconsiders the requirement of an advisory session or any student as decided \nby the Head of the Institution. The student advisor will raise an evaluation \nreport at the end of each semester in respect of each student in his/her \ngroup that covers the students' personality traits, trends and academic \nperformance during the semester. b.
